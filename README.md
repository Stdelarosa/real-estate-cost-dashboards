# 🏢 Real Estate Operations & Cost Optimization Dashboards

**Client:** Confidential NYC Real Estate Firm  
**Role:** Operations Assistant at Ops Made Simple  
**Timeframe:** 2023–2024  
**Tools:** Google Sheets, Asana

## 📌 Project Summary

This project focused on enhancing cost visibility and operational decision-making for a real estate firm managing 34 residential properties in New York City. The client’s cost data—spanning vendors and internal labor—was fragmented across platforms and lacked structured reporting.

### 🚩 Challenge
The firm lacked centralized insights into vendor and labor costs across their portfolio. Operational expenditures were scattered and manually tracked, creating inefficiencies in budgeting, vendor management, and decision-making.

### ✅ Solution

I led the development of interactive dashboards and tools to centralize data and surface actionable insights:

1. **Cost per Building Dashboard**  
   Visualized year-over-year spending by category (e.g. Repair, Maintenance, Supplies) across all buildings.

2. **Vendor Cost Dashboard**  
   Tracked external vendor spending, helping identify high-cost vendors and support data-driven negotiations.

3. **Labor Dashboard**  
   Monitored internal staff hours and overtime across Admin, Support, and Super teams to uncover staffing inefficiencies.

> All dashboards were built and visualized using **Google Sheets**, with data cleaned and transformed from **Asana exports**.

### 📈 Results & Impact

- **Strategic Acquisition:** The firm acquired a high-cost vendor after insights from the dashboard revealed long-term savings potential.
- **Operational Visibility:** Management gained real-time insights across all properties and labor types.
- **Increased Efficiency:** Manual reporting was eliminated, saving hours per week and allowing better strategic focus.
- **Cost Optimization:** Enabled granular cost analysis, which highlighted unnecessary overtime and inefficient vendor billing.
